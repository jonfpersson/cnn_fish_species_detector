# Implementation of VGG19 with added trainable layers

A convolutional neural network based on VGG19 able to classify pictures

# Project includes:

Server.py for loading model and evaluate pictures

Check.py for sending pictures to server

main.py loading of dataset

vgg19.py handles training and definition of model

# Datastructure follows:

data/test

data/validation

data/train

# Libs needed:

Tensorflow 2.4.1

Cuda 11.1

cuDNN version 8

Keras 2.3.1
